                  There are many factors that can independently affect user experience on the
                  internet, including - but not limited to - a user's internet connection speed,
                  reliability of the access network, availability and load characteristics of the
                  application servers and in some cases, the configuration of the users' in-home
                  network. Individual and isolated measures like access speed or server capacity do
                  not capture the real user experience. An end to end, application-level
                  performance measurement that includes all the influencers in the equation is the
                  right approach to measure and quantify the true internet user experience.

                  Presented here is a methodology to rate Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in
                  terms of YouTube video capability, based on sustained application level
                  performance measurements. The objective is to present a rating that is
                  meaningful, easy to understand and one that closely reflects the real world
                  internet experience.

                  A typical YouTube video playback consists of a YouTube client (player) fetching
                  video bytes in a streaming fashion from a YouTube server (CDN), in one or more
                  requests (e.g. HTTP GET). The first step in determining ISP ratings is to measure
                  the sustained speed at which these video bytes are transferred from server to the
                  client. To measure the achieved application level throughput (goodput), the
                  following are recorded for each request:
                </p>
                <ol start="1">
                  <li>
                    <span class="number">1)</span> <strong>Request Identity:</strong> The
                    originating request's timestamp, access network (e.g. network block, autonomous
                    system number of ISP) and the coarse geographical location (e.g. country,
                    metro), derived from client attributes such as IP address, User Agent, etc.
                    Note that the IP to location translation done by our automated systems may
                    return a location that is incorrect for some users.

                  <li>
                    <span class="number">2)</span> <strong>Response Size:</strong> The number of
                    application bytes (including application headers but excluding any kernel level
                    overhead) transferred by the server to the client, in response to the request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="number">3)</span> <strong>Response Time:</strong> The time taken
                    to service the request by server, including network transmission time (all
                    bytes acknowledged by the receiver).

                </ol>
                <p>
                  Based on these measurements, the goodput for a given request 'R' is computed
                  using the formula below. Each measured request is considered a goodput sample.

                    Ratings are derived by aggregating relevant goodput samples recorded in the
                    measurements phase. The methodology supports ratings to be computed at various
                    levels of granularity, for the selected dimensions. For example, the rating for
                    an ISP could be calculated for various time slices (e.g. hour, day, week,
                    month) and/or at various geographical levels (e.g. country, province, metro,
                    city).

                    'L' (e.g. San Francisco, CA, USA), the rating for an ISP 'P' (e.g. Comcast) is
                    computed as follows:

                        ISP rating criteria is defined in terms of minimum level of GAT volume
                        requirement for each rating level. Since this metric is designed to reflect
                        consistency and reliability of the ISP's network, the bar needs to be set
                        at a level that captures sustained performance rather than typical
                        (average) performance. To that effect we define three rating scales: GAT-90
                        (90% of requests above threshold), GAT-95 (95% of requests above
                        threshold), GAT-99 (99% of requests above threshold) to reflect different
                        levels of reliability.

                      <p>
                        The following table defines the criteria used to determine the final ISP
                        rating in our methodology, using GAT-90. The 90% bar is chosen after
                        careful consideration of observed practical performance in the field. The
                        bar will closely follow the evolving network capability over time.

                    products that promise different speeds. Does the methodology rate each product
                    and speed separately?</strong><br>
                    Each ISP can provide appropriate product names and speeds for its different
                    offerings, and the labels in the report depend on the information we have from
                    the ISP. In some cases, ISPs will provide us information that allows us to
                    identify and rate the different products and speeds. In other cases, we don’t
                    have detailed information about the speeds offered to consumers, so we provide
                    a general rating of the product across all speeds.

                    use mean or median?</strong><br>
                    At Google, we strongly believe that consistent and reliable network performance
                    is key to a great user experience on the internet. Hence the choice of 90% bar.
                    I.e. one can expect the rated level of performance 9 out of 10 times. While
                    mean and median values are useful to represent average network performance,
                    they are not well suited for the purpose of the rating metric which tries to
                    capture the sustained level of the network performance.

                    reward networks that offer sustained high performance during high service usage
                    hours?</strong><br>
                    Yes. Since the GAT volume is request (load) based, high YouTube consumption
                    time periods (e.g. evenings) would contribute more towards the GAT volume pool,
                    thereby offering a disproportionate influence on the final rating. The
                    methodology is naturally normalized for usage.

                    Requests serving video in modern delivery formats (e.g. DASH, HLS) are included
                    in the ratings computation. Legacy video formats (e.g. non-adaptive progressive
                    playbacks, RTSP) are excluded due to lack of high measurement confidence in
                    older streaming delivery mechanisms. This is done in the interest of
                    maintaining high degree of accuracy in computed ISP ratings.
